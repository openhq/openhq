# Open HQ

Open source project management app.

## Deploy to Heroku

To make using Open HQ as easy as possible we have optimised it for usage on Heroku with the 1 click deploy button, however for now we still require you to have a mailgun and amazon s3 account.

### Prerequisites

1. **File upload storage** - Sign up for [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com) and have your S3 AWS access key ID, secret access key and S3 bucket name ready.
2. **Sending Email** - Sign up for [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com) and have your API key, mailgun domain and from address ready.

Once you have these setup click the magic deploy button, enter your details and get started with Open HQ!
